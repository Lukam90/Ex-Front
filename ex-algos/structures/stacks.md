## Stacks

The stack is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of LIFO (Last In First Out).

The last element inserted into the stack is the 1st element to be removed.

The 2 main operations are :

- **push()**, to add an element to the collection
- **pop()**, to remove the most recent element from the collection

Ex :

- browser history tracking
- undo operation when typing
- expression conversions
- call stack in JS runtime
